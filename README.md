# screen-recorder-app
trying to make apps with electron 
(was using an old fireship tutorial but the newer version of electron seems to give problems with that code, hence small changes and a few errors to fix)
## Current Progress
- can select which screen to use
- display the screen live

## TODO
- complete the recording feature and map to start and stop buttons
